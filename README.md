# Auto-PPT Generator

Auto-PPT Generator is a web application that transforms bulk user text (markdown or prose) into fully styled PowerPoint presentations. Using a user-uploaded PowerPoint template, it applies the templateâ€™s visual style, including layouts, fonts, colors, and images, to produce polished presentations automatically.

## Features

- Paste or upload large chunks of text for slide generation
- Upload any PowerPoint template (.pptx or .potx) for styling
- Choose to use LLM-powered slide structuring with your own API key (optional)
- Heuristic fallback mode for quick, no-key slide generation
- Reuses images from the uploaded template (no AI-generated images)
- Download the generated .pptx file matching your brand/style
